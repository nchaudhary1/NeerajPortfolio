# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects .

***

[Build a predictive model that answers 'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' using passenger data like age, gender, class etc.](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/titanic)

<img src="images/Titanic.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting the survival of passenger on the basis of their age, gender, socio-economic class etc during the sinking of Titanic.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict whether or not the passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.[**79.89%** accuracy](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/titanic/blob/main/Untitled52.ipynb).

- Used Logistic Regression  to predict whether or not the passsenger survived the sinking of Titanic. 
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Logistic regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/breastcancer)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**99%** accuracy using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/breastcancer/blob/main/breastcancer.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/CatOrDogPrediction)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**77%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/CatOrDogPrediction/blob/main/CNN59.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat

[K-Means clustering model for State authorities/Policy makers](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/marketing_campaign)

<img src="images/marketing_campaign.jpeg?raw=true"/>
 
<b>Skills used:</b> Python,Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, K-Means clustering

<b>Project objctive: </b> Based on the K-Means clustering model we could give useful insights to the authorities to group the people into respective catagories

<b>Quantifiable Result:</b> Based on the model all were grouped into 3 clusters, so k = 3, which got justified by Schilhoutee score = 0.931

   - Fitted the data to clustering model
   - Calculated the number of clusters for the data
   - Fitted the model with K-Means and Hierarchical clustering
   - Compared the resluts for both methods
   - Calculated the Schiloutee score of the model which was 0.931

<b>Project Objective:</b> Implementing Deep Neural Network with Keras for handwritting classification and recognition

<b>Quantifiable Results:</b>

  - Loss = 0.26 - 0.03 = Final Model Eval = 98.7%
  - Load the data
  - Initial data indagation
  - Initial EDA
  - Data Prepping

 [Predicting customer subscription for term deposit](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/LogisticRegresion_project)
<img src=“images/banking.jpg?raw=true”/>
<b>Skills used:</b> Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SKlearn, Logistic Regression, SMOTE, RFE
<b>Project Objective:</b> Used logistic regression to predict customer subscriptions for there term deposit (Used real worked data from UCI, machine learning repository)
<b>Quantifiable Results:</b> Used Logistic regression classifier got 86.09 % of model accuracy which helps the bank to estimate their depositors in advance
  - Used logistic regression to explore and make note of attributes information
  - Use data cleaning principles to get rid of the unwanted data
  - Explore data with groupby function and analyzing it
  - Used Logistic regression classifier to improve on the data to make better prediction on whether the client will subcribe or not
  - Explored a machine learning approach to predict by using Sklearn numeric
