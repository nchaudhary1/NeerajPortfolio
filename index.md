# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects .

[Build a predictive model that answers 'what sorts of people were more likely to survive?' using passenger data like age, gender, class etc.](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/titanic)

<img src="images/Titanic.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting the survival of passenger on the basis of their age, gender, socio-economic class etc during the sinking of Titanic.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict whether or not the passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.[**79.89%** accuracy](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/titanic/blob/main/Untitled52.ipynb).

- Used Logistic Regression  to predict whether or not the passsenger survived the sinking of Titanic. 
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Logistic regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/breastcancer)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**99%** accuracy using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/breastcancer/blob/main/breastcancer.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/CatOrDogPrediction)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**77%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/nchaudhary1/CatOrDogPrediction/blob/main/CNN59.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
